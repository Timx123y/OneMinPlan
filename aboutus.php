					OneMinPlan was born from the discussions of two seasoned travellers, who, despite their experience, still could not escape from the horrors of research and itinerary planning.

					With the help of a couple travel enthusiasts and computer geeks, our vision of helping travellers create personalised itineraries with zero hassle is slowly becoming reality.
